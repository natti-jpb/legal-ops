The speaker, a former teacher turned psychologist, describes their journey from teaching seventh-grade math to studying predictors of success in diverse environments such as West Point Military Academy, the National Spelling Bee, tough urban schools, and private companies. Their research found that grit—defined as passion and perseverance for long-term goals—is a stronger predictor of success than IQ, talent, or other factors. The speaker highlights that while grit is crucial, science currently knows little about how to effectively build it. They mention the growth mindset, developed by Carol Dweck, as a promising approach to fostering grit but emphasize the need for further research and testing to develop reliable methods to cultivate grit in children and adults.",
